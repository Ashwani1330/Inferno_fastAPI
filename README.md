## üöÄ Features

- **Performance Data Collection**: Record and store user performance metrics in fire emergency simulations
- **Performance Scoring**: Calculate evacuation efficiency scores based on custom algorithms
- **Personalized Reports**: Generate and email personalized performance reports to participants
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive visualization dashboard for researchers
- **Data Analysis**: Advanced statistical analysis of performance data including:
  - Demographic analysis
  - Scene type comparisons
  - Time-series trend analysis
  - Correlations between parameters
  - Predictive modeling

## üìä Dashboard

The analytics dashboard provides researchers with comprehensive visualization tools:

- Key performance metrics
- Demographic breakdowns
- Performance comparisons by age group, scene type, and difficulty

```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:10000`.

## üíª API Endpoints

### Performance Endpoints
- `POST /api/performance` - Submit performance data from VR sessions
- `GET /api/performance` - Retrieve all performance records
- `GET /api/performance/report` - Generate HTML performance report
- `GET /api/performance/analysis` - Get detailed statistical analysis

### Analytics
- `GET /analytics` - Redirects to dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Interactive analytics dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard-tab/{tab_name}` - Load specific dashboard tab data

## üìã Data Model

Performance data includes:
- User information (email, age)
- Session information (scene type, difficulty)
- Time metrics (time to find extinguisher, time to extinguish fire, etc.)
- Performance score
- Timestamp

## üîå Dependencies

- FastAPI - Modern Python web framework
- Motor - Asynchronous MongoDB driver
- Pandas/NumPy - Data analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data visualization
- scikit-learn - Machine learning for predictive modeling
- Redis/FastAPI-cache - Caching for performance optimization

## üß† Performance Score Calculation

The application uses a custom algorithm to calculate an Evacuation Efficiency Score (EES) based on:
- User age (weighted differently for different age groups)
- Time to find extinguisher
- Time to extinguish fire
- Time to trigger alarm
- Time to find exit
- Mobility score

## üîí Security

- Anonymous data collection option
- Data anonymization for research dashboard
